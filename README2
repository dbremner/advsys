The file 'newadv.pch' contains a set of diffs to add smart articles
to the adventure compiler system.  They are being distributed in
this way because David Betz (the original author) wants his source
distributed *only* in unmodified form.  If you make changes or
additions to the source, please distribute them as diffs rather
than modified files (or at least include the original source) when
giving it to your friends.
