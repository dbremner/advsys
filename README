ADVSYS is a special purpose programming language that was
specifically designed to be used to write computer text
adventure games.  It includes a facility for defining the kinds
of objects that are common in adventures.  Some objects
represent locations on the game map, some objects represent
things that the player can find while exploring the adventure
world, and some objects represent other characters that the
adventurer can encounter during his or her journeys.  The
adventure language also provides a facility to define actions.
Actions are short sections of code that determine what happens
in response to a command from the player.  These two concepts,
"objects" and "actions" form the basis for the adventure
language.
